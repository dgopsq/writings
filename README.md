# 📚 Writings

This is my personal 🪐 **s p a c e** ☄️, here I write stuff about technology (and maybe something else too in the future).

## Stack

This space has been written using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It's just a static website based on a bunch of markdown files!

You can find out more about what other technology I'm using by reading the [package.json](https://github.com/dgopsq/writings/blob/master/package.json#L12-L24) file.

## DevOps

This website is hosted through [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and a deploy is triggered on every commit on the `master` branch. When this happens a GitHub action is dispatched too sending all the articles to [dev.to](https://dev.to/dgopsq) in order to have them always updated across multiple channels.
