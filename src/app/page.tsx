          Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a strong knowledge of
          React / React Native and NodeJS. I've also played with almost every
          other language out there, including TypeScript, Scala, Rust, and
          PureScript. Functional programming is my go-to paradigm when possible,
          and I've had the opportunity to use it extensively in my career.
