          Ehi ðŸ‘‹ I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a strong knowledge in
          React / React Native and NodeJS. I also played with almost every other
          language out there including TypeScript, Scala, Rust and PureScript.
          Functional programming is my go-to paradigm when possible and I had
          the opportunity to use it extensively in my career.
